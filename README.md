Harry Potter Homework portfolio assignment 2
Site link https://bowdwin.github.io/02-bootstrapportfolio/
## About / Synopsis

* This was our 2nd homework assignement.  Instead of doing a portfolio about myself,  I figured I would create a portfolio page of Harry Potter Books and Movies as well as an about page of the author and a contact form.  All books link to the books offical sites and the movies link to trailers on youtube.com
* Project status: working/prototype
